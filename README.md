# 🎭 Emotion Detection from Text and Speech
This project focuses on detecting human emotions using both textual and audio (speech) inputs. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) techniques, the system can identify emotions like happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more from text and speech data.

# 📌 Features
📝 Text Emotion Detection using NLP techniques

🔊 Speech Emotion Recognition using audio signal processing

🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning models for accurate emotion classification

📊 Visualization of results and emotion distribution

🔁 Modular and scalable code structure

# 🧠 Techniques Used
Text Emotion Detection
Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF 
Classification Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, BERT

Speech Emotion Recognition
Preprocessing: Noise reduction, Silence trimming

Feature Extraction: MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Contrast

Classification Models: CNN, LSTM, SVM

# 🛠️ Future Improvements
Integrate real-time emotion detection from microphone or chat

Multimodal emotion fusion (combining text + speech simultaneously)

Add support for more emotions and languages
